### Hi ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m a data scientist passionate about the intersection of data, storytelling, and innovation. With expertise in machine learning, data visualization, and statistical analysis, I work on end-to-end data science projectsâ€”transforming raw data into actionable insights.

I have a strong interest in generative AI and its potential to create novel solutions. Beyond my academic pursuits, I enjoy experimenting with generative art, data-driven storytelling, and creative applications of AI.

I believe in continuous learning, combining formal education with hands-on projects and online resources. I'm always looking for opportunities to apply data science to meaningful causes and collaborate on impactful initiatives.

Letâ€™s connect and explore data-driven possibilities together!
