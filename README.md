### Hi ðŸ‘‹
I'm a graduate student deeply passionate about the intersection of data and storytelling. With a strong belief in their power to drive meaningful change, I spend my days immersed in programming and data analysis, focusing on areas like data visualization and machine learning.

My academic pursuits often involve end-to-end data science projects, from gathering data to uncovering insights using advanced techniques. I'm particularly interested in exploring the application of generative AI algorithms for creating novel solutions.

During my downtime, I enjoy working on personal projects, whether it's experimenting with generative art or diving into data-driven storytelling. I find joy in pushing the boundaries of creativity and innovation.

While I value formal education, I also leverage online resources to augment my learning, focusing on a balanced approach that integrates both.

I actively seek opportunities to contribute my skills and knowledge to meaningful causes, participating in data-driven research initiatives and collaborating with local organizations to make a positive impact.

Feel free to connect and explore data-driven possibilities together!
